WP HIVE is a plugin that brings affordable marketing automation to WordPress.

For the legacy version please see the Changelog notes below.

== Description ==

If you run a B2B or lead generation site based on WordPress, WP HIVE is a simple solution to get started with marketing automation and inbound marketing without a large initial investment.

What is Marketing Automation?

According to Eloqua (an Oracle company), marketing automation is the process of managing the target, time, and content of a business's marketing messages automatically as response to potential clients for their inward actions and for their online conduct.

In simple terms, with WP HIVE your WordPress site will become a fine-tuned system for acquiring leads (email addresses) in exchange for files (ebooks, whitepapers, infographics, charts, templates, videos, podcasts etc) you offer for download. You will be able to track what pages of your site leads are browsing, what countries they come from, and how they found out about your site (Google, other referral sites etc). Same powerful features offered by SaaS providers like HubSpot, Marketo or Eloqua are now available for free to small business owners to try on their site without the burden of migrating from WordPress or integrating another 3rd party system.

Some features of WP HIVE (Free Version):

* Plugin architecture, simple to install
* Compatible with almost all third party themes and plugins
* Offer files for download in exchange for registration/email
* Track downloads and form submissions in Google Analytics
* Score leads based on country of origin, referral and pages visited on your site.


WP HIVE Premium (Paid Version) offers self-hosted WordPress websites additional marketing automation functionality similar to HubSpot and Marketo:

* Create mobile-ready landing pages
* Customize Call-to-Action buttons
* Run unlimited email campaigns
* Nurture leads with autoresponder sequences
* Track opened, clicked, bounced & unsubscribed emails
* Profile leads and discover their social network accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Google+ etc)
* Score and segment leads based on their activity
* Perform A/B testing via Google Experiments and track conversion in Google Analytics

= 1.0.0 =
* WP HIVE relaunched as a free WordPress marketing automation alternative to HubSpot

== LEGACY Version ==

WP Hive was initially a WordPress Plugin that allowed multiple WordPress sites to run on a single installation.

It was intended to be used in a multi-site, single administrator environment and was for the WordPress administrator who managed many sites and was looking for a way to consolidate the plugins, themes, and files for all their sites with ease.

The admin interface made it incredibly easy to add new sites to the ‘Hive’. This original plugin worked up to v3.1 and was superseded once WordPress Multi-site was incorporated in the main development tree.
